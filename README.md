Future Visitors Prediction System

Welcome to the Future Visitors Prediction System for [Company Name]! 📈✨This project uses machine learning to predict the future number of visitors based on historical data, helping the company optimize resources, staffing, and marketing strategies.

🔗 Project Overview

This predictive system was developed using historical visitor records, applying time series models (such as ARIMA, Prophet, or LSTM) to forecast future trends with high accuracy.

🚀 How to Run

1️⃣ Load the dataset (data.csv) and explore its structure.2️⃣ Run the preprocessing steps to clean and prepare the data.3️⃣ Train the prediction model (or load the pre-trained model from model.pkl).4️⃣ Generate predictions for future periods.5️⃣ Visualize the results using plots and tables provided in the notebook.

🛠️ Requirements

Python 3

pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

(Optional) TensorFlow/Keras if using LSTM models

📊 Results
